# LineageOS updater shortcut

This very simple app provides an app icon for the [LineageOS updater](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_packages_apps_Updater).

It works around the fact that the Updater app does not have its own icon in the launcher and can only be launched from a submenu of the Settings app.
(The Settings widget can also be used, but it has the same icon as the Settings app and is not available in the app drawer.)
