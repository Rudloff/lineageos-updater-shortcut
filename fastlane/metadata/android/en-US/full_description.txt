This very simple app provides an app icon for the LineageOS updater.

It works around the fact that the Updater app does not have its own icon in the launcher and can only be launched from a submenu of the Settings app.
(The Settings widget can also be used, but it has the same icon as the Settings app and is not available in the app drawer.)
